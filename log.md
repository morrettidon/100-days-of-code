# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 25, 2020  

**Today's Progress**: I spent time building a Survey Form for the Responsive Web Design Certification.  I learned how to use HTML fieldset, legend, and label tags better. I spent time understanding how the CSS box sizing property works.  I understood how to use the CSS box-sizing property.  It's good to use because you don't have to worry about an element's width or height changing if you adjust the border or padding.  So you set box-sizing to border-box to make sure the element's height and width stays the same.  

**Thoughts:** I feel like I need to improve on my ability to center things.  Whether it's a div, an image, some text, a heading, a video, a map --- literally anything.  I always to set the margin to 0 for the top/bottom and auto for left/right.  If it's a flex box you can set justify-content to center and align-items to center.  I have trouble remembering how to center an image. I will continue working on everything so I can remember it better when I code.  I can always quickly find the information that I need, but I wish I knew it instantly when I was coding.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
